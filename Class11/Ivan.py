# Task 1: Create a program that uses a for loop to print the numbers 1 to 10, but skips the number 5.



# Task 2: Create a program that finds the maximum number in an array (but without using the max() function).



# Task 3: Create a program that prints the string "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, from 1 to 100.




# Task 4: Create a program that reverses a string. E.g: "Anson" should become "nosnA".
